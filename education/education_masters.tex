\section{Masters Thesis}

\cvitem{Title}{\emph{Efficient Evidence Accumulation Clustering for large datasets/big data}}
\cvitem{Supervisors}{Professor Ana Fred \& Dr. Helena Aidos}
\cvitem{Description}{This thesis focused on exploring the feasability of applying Evidence Accumulation Clustering to large datasets. I explored different areas from quantum clustering techniques to GPU based alrogithms. The result was the development of solution that is several times faster and more memory efficient than the origina, using different strategies.}
